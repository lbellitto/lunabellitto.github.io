        <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
        <p>I am from a little town in Italy, but I have lived in different countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. I also spent a few months in South America. 
          I love traveling and exploring new cultures, which has helped me develop a global perspective and adaptability.
          I am passionate about learning new languages and currently speak English, Italian, Spanish, and a little bit of French.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy trying new activities as I like learning new skills and meeting new people.</p>

        <p><strong>Education</strong></p>
        <p>I like analysing data to understand underlying patterns in the world. 
          I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a Master of Science in Computational Social Science, 
          where I focused on machine learning, data science, and statistical modeling, applying these methods to fields 
          such as economics, political science, and software engineering.</p>
        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Arts in International Affairs with a minor in Legal Studies from John Cabot University in Rome, Italy, 
          during which I developed a strong interest in Economics and Human Rights.</p>

        <p><strong>Publications</strong></p>
        <p>As a result of one of my research projects, I co-authored an article titled <em>"DeepComplete: Adversarial Autoencoders for Multiple Imputation"</em>. The article was presented at the 2025 Midwest Political Science Association Conference (MPSA) in Chicago, and it is currently under review for publication. I am excited to post the link to the article soon!</p>
