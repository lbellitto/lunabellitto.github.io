      <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
      <p>I am from a little town in Italy, but I have lived in different countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. I also spent a few months in South America.<br>
      I love traveling and exploring new cultures, which has helped me develop a global perspective and adaptability.<br>
      I am passionate about learning new languages and currently speak English, Italian, Spanish, and a little bit of French.<br>
      In my free time, I enjoy trying new activities as I like learning new skills and meeting new people.</p>

      <p><strong>Education</strong></p>
      <p>I like analysing data to understand underlying patterns in the world. I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a Master of Science in Computational Social Science,
      where I focused on machine learning, data science, and statistical modeling, applying these methods to fields such as economics, political science, and software engineering.<br>
      I hold a Bachelor of Arts in International Affairs with a minor in Legal Studies from John Cabot University in Rome, Italy, during which I developed a strong interest in Economics and Human Rights.</p>

      <p><strong>Publications</strong></p>
      <p>As a result of one of my research, I co-authored an article titled "DeepComplete: Adversarial Autoencoders for Multiple Imputation". 
      The article was presented at the 2025 Midwest Political Science Association Conference (MPSA) in Chicago, and it is currently under review for publication.<br>
      I am excited to post the link to the article soon!</p>
