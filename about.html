      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <strong> Background</strong>
      <p> I am from a little town in Italy, but I have lived in different countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. I also spent a few months in South America. <br>
        I love traveling and exploring new cultures, which has helped me develop a global perspective and adaptability. <br>
        I am passionate about learning new languages and currently speak English, Italian, Spanish, and a little bit of French. <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy trying new activities as I like learning new skills and meeting new people. <br> <br>

      <strong> Education</strong>
      <p>
       I like analysing data to understand underlying patterns in the world. <r>
        I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a Master of Science in Computational Social Science,
         where I focused on machine learning, data science, and statistical modeling, 
         applying these methods to fields such as economics, political science, and software engineering.<br>
          I hold a Bachelor of Arts in International Affairs with a minor in Legal Studies from John Cabot University in Rome, Italy, 
          during which I developed a strong interest in Economics and Human Rights. <br><br> 

      <strong> Publications</strong>
      <p>
        As a result of one of my research, I co-authored an article titled "DeepComplete: Adversarial Autoencoders for Multiple Imputation". 
        The article was presented at the 2025 Midwest Political Science Association Conference (MPSA) in Chicago, and it is currently under review for publication. <br>
          I am excited to post the link to the article soon! <br>
